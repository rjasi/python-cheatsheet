# python-cheatsheet
My curated list of useful python 3 tricks. Helpful for coding interviews and general day to day tasks

Unlike online docs and other sites, I don't bloat it with too many examples or long detailed explanations (not the point of this anyway). Web pages are also distracting. Having the code snippet is short sweet and simple. Try re-writing my code samples to really drill it into your head

Each group of tips has its own folder

# What's included?

1. The standard library or anything that you don't need to pip install

2. Standard modules that you don't need to pip install
    * os

3. Non standard but popular tools, frameworks, modules
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * pyspark
    * argparse
    * opencv
    * requests


4. Random facts

5. Bad examples from articles

# Notes

There are probably mistakes and typos in the code but all examples
will run, except for the ones that intentionally throw exceptions

# TODO

1. add jupyter notebooks
